<p>After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, anarchists seized important buildings, factories, farms, churches and arms in the parts of Spain that had not been taken by the fascist rebels. This specific event is called Spanish Revolution. In spite of a central government still existing, Catalonia was taken over by workers and run as libertarian socialist communes. Two facts are important noting about Revolutionary Catalonia, the first is that like the Paris Commune of 1871 they were eventually crushed and oppressed because they were outside the system. The Bolsheviki did not succeed by fixing anything, they rigged it for themselves. The second is that pre-war anarchists were not half-hearted libertarians like today's conservatives, they destroyed every shackle they found. To them, American liberalism did not destroy the prisons of men, it split it in smaller ones and destroyed the balance of powers with selective liberation. Ayn Rand was not entirely wrong, she was just shortsighted, American collectivism is an illness caused by the rejection of libertarianism as a foreign body inside American individualist society.</p>
<p>Today, syndicalism is dying and the state took over as the only one authorized to manage society, even though it is not the only one, not even the most powerful to do so. Those other de facto powers are informal and will never receive formal authorization to manage society, so 'working through the system' means using democracy to forge a path to libertarianism. In an age when 'anarchist' is closer to an insult than a political view, the task of devolving power to the people is anything but simple and quick. The implications of that is that appearance of libertarianism could hide perilous imbalances of power that in turn could make slaves of seemingly free people.</p>
<p>When we start thinking about solving the problem, the first thing that comes to mind is demonization of the government by figures such as Ronald Reagan and Ron Paul, but the reactionary naivety of government reduction would only reboot the system to a more primitive state. People's blood and sweat, world's resources and lost opportunity are the entropy of such system. The clock will not be turned back since entropy does not decrease, we will just double the entropy to eventually reach the same place. That is only desirable if one assume that every law or government action is evil, a simplistic and formulaic statement that could not possibly withstand careful analysis.</p>
<p>One can not talk about a libertarian state without feeling a bit silly, because it gives an idea of central top-down government. One can not use a strongly top-down approach to force its view of what libertarian is, even if it is a grassroot movement it is still equivalent to ochlocracy. So the problem of liberation of the state is not one of the reduction, but one of the decentralization, divide and conquer. Two strategies that can be used to decentralize is splitting the jurisdictions and splitting the bureaucracy. Turning a country in two or more is a multiplication miracle that more people should try, but in the current world where citizens don't own their own sovereignty, sub-national autonomy is a monster in the form of a totalitarian system of subjugation of people to layers of self-owned governments. Autonomy is a confession of dependence to the central government and interdependence with the federation, it creates a tributary relation to an abstract sovereign claim and renounces its independence for it. Falling short of full independence, divisions of jurisdictions must be merely administrative if they are intended to be conquered, meaning solved. To leave this unlikely scenario behind, I will close with an example, the fiscal wars between sub-national entities like states, counties and towns; and the even more complex distribution of tax and authority between these different levels of government.</p>
<p>Splitting the government bureaucracy has been done in explicit and ad hoc ways for a long time. We kicked out of education things that didn't belong there, such as churches, notwithstanding merit versus morality issues, those things have nothing to do with education and their direct meddling would only get in the way of education. Like laïcité removed the Catholic Church from government and education in France, without affecting Catholicism itself, the relationship between different powers must be made transparent and well defined, not destroyed. Even better example is Montesquieu's tripartite system that separated powers of government between three branches (executive, legislative and judiciary). The three powers have a clear-cut division of labor and their power to affect each other is considerable, but relatively transparent and well-defined. Some independent agencies and bodies inside government can generate the best examples, as long as they are independent.</p>
<p>If we lose sight of the multidimensionality of society and target only government, then all of this will be in vain as the gained efficiency and transparency will have weakened some of its powers, making society vulnerable to the newly significant relative strength of other powers of society. Other powers of society are immune to direct management, it is where lies the danger of immediatism preached by populists of left and right. Any public policy or grassroot action will be ineffective to solve the libertarian problem if they do not foment restructuring of society towards decentralization. There can not be decentralization without both universality and egalitarianism. If only sectors of society have access to education, someone will be always marginalized. If everyone has access to education but some people have better education than others, then it is only a two-dimensional decentralization that can be easily overlooked, but it is incomplete. Contrary to conservative and reactionary belief, a bigger government could actually bring us closer to a libertarian society, while privatization could affect the equilibrium of powers, surrendering whole sectors of society to other powers. The public-private dichotomy is a false one, since libertarianism is not simply about power being in private hands, but about power being everyone own's hands. Another false dichotomy is in methodology, between equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. They are both in the point of view of the distributor, but no power should be held by anyone, any step that is not towards decentralization is in not in the path to libertarianism, or it is not in the right direction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in a purely libertarian society, there is no private and public because no one really owns anything but themselves. Any type of power over anything is a restriction on freedom, therefore a deviation from libertarianism. If a libertarian socialist society is the worldly realization of decentralization, then it is the final stop in the process of decentralization of the society, holistically, because balance is decentralization.</p></body></html>
